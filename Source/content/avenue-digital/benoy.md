Development of a design-led brochureware website showing off Benoy's project portfolio. Project case study pages made use of Umbraco's grid editor which offered content editors flexible layout options. The site was image heavy, so the Umbraco media library was configured to store images in Azure blob storage and serve them over the Azure CDN.
