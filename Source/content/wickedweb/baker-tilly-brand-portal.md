Development of a suite of ASP.NET user controls allowing users to create branded stationery (business cards and letterheads). PDF generation was handled using the Aspose PDF library, and allowed multi-lingual stationery to be created (including Chinese, Arabic, and Hebrew). These user controls were integrated into the company's existing extranet running on Umbraco.
